I put my dotfiles here and link them to my home directory like so:

```
$ ln -s personal/.nvimrc ~/.nvimrc
```

Other than dotfiles, there are folders for miscellaneous config files:

 - `key_remaps` for adding functionality to [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/)
 - `settings_tweaks` for `defaults write` commands and osx preferences
